|  Form   | Performance | Accessibility | Best Practices |   SEO   |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Mobile  | 94/100      | N/A           | 100/100        | 100/100 |         
| Desktop | 99/100      | N/A           | 100/100        | 100/100 |

I think we can improve accessibility by including aria labels to divs to improve semantic structure.

### 5. Data Gathering

You can help us by gathering data on:

- Building Information
- Important POIs (restrooms, landmarks, etc...) 
- Picture references

You can store the data in public access cloud storage like Google Drive.
